#Chapter 1: Signals and Systems

Scratch:
1.1
continuous/discrete system
the total energy/power over finite/infinite time calculation for both systems => energy/power may not refer to real physical energy/power
3 types of system over infinite time: 1. E => finite, P => 0; 2. P => finite, E => infinite; P/E => infinite;
1.2
time shift, time reversal, time scaling, periodic, aperiodic, even, odd => any signal can broken into even & odd parts
1.3
