#Chapter 2: MOS Transistor Theory

Scratch:
2.1
MOS is a majority-carrier device => use only majority-carrier
PN junction is a minory-carrier device => use both majority and minory-carrier => remind bipolar transaction => minority determine the feature
3 mode: accumulation (Vg < 0) => depletion (0 < Vg < Vt) => inversion (Vt < Vg)
Vt depends on 1)dopants in body 2)oxide dialetric thickness
Note Vgs determines if channel is on or off, Vds = Vgs - Vgd determines if electric field exists between source and drain to form displacement current
3 MOS operations: cutoff, linear, saturation => cutoff means both side of channel are OFF; linear means both side of channel are ON; saturation means only source side of channel is ON (the drain side is pinched off)
note in linear operation, Ids is controlled by Vds (positive proportional), while in saturation operation, Ids is controlled by gate (independent of Vds)
another explanation about saturation => to keep channel ON, gate voltage must be at least Vt higher than Vs or Vd. So if Vd is larger than Vgs-Vt, the drain side is OFF and Vds lost control of Ids => Ids is independent of Vds => this become a current source
parasitic capacitance is the capacitance from source/drain to body
2.2
long channel model assumes LOW lateral electric field between source and drain, which is no longer valid in nanometer devices => use short channel model
equation 2.5 express the linearity between Vds and Ids
The saturation pinch off point occurs when Vds = Vdsat = VGT => equation 2.8 give square-law behavior of VGT to Ids => Note that in linear VGT >> Vds while in saturation Vds is comparable to VGT
equation 2.9 is wrong and equation 10 is a summary of Ion (Ioff is 0 in long channel model) => in digital circuit MOS usually works in saturation since the gate and the drain shares the same power rail
note that this Schokley model does not consider mobility degradation and velocity saturation in high electric field (assumption is LOW electric field) => see 2.4
he holes mobility is typically lower than that of electrons (a raito of 2-3) => Ids in pMOS is smaller 
2.3
2.3.1
note that the gate is not one of the transistor's terminals => thus it is a 2-terminal device
not all transistors in logic are of minmum manufacturable length => short channel effect in 2.4.3.3 and TBD in 5.3.3
parastic capacitor includes diffusion capacitance of source and drain
difussion region geometries: 1) isolated; 2) shared; 3) merged;
diffusion capacitance is comparable to gate capacitance, about 1fF/um
2.3.2
gate capacitance consists of 1) intrinsic capacitance over channel Cgc; 2) overlap capacitance to source/drain Cgol (appear in real device)
Cgc is further divided into 1) Cgb (to body); 2) Cgs (to source); 3) Cgd (to drain);
These 3 parts has differnt value under cutoff, linear and saturation considering the botton plate of Cgc is at different position => see Figure 2.9
table 2.1 gives a summary of 3 capacitances: 1) Cgb is initial C0 and then decrease to 0 before enter linear (when not cutoff, the conductive channel replace the bottom plate, no capacitance to body exists; 2) Cgs & Cgd appear when no cutoff => channel shares charges with source and drain; 3) Both Cgs & Cgd shares 1/2 of C0 at first and Cgs increases to 2/3 and Cgd decrease to 0 in saturation due to the pinchoff; 4) in total Cgc is C0 before saturation and down to 2/3 in saturation;
note the gate capacitance also depends on the data it-self => see Figure 2.11
2.3.3
a depletion region contains no carriers => that way the capacitance from its sides forms
the diffusion capacitance depends on 1) area WD; 2) perimeter 2W+2D; => why the perimeter matters TBD: edge effect? see Semiconductor Physics
Cj is junction capacitance at zero bias, process-dependent
Mj is junction grading coefficient, diffusion gradient-dependent
in general Vsb or Vdb increase, Csb or Cdb decrease => TBD: is this correct?
Figure 2.13 give a summary of capacitance of a MOS transistor: Cgs, Cgd, Cgb, Csb, Cdb
2.4
"velocity saturation": saturation current Isat did not ideally quadraticlly increase as Vds increase => scatter off the lattice more ofen as velocity increase => in high lateral Vds velocity is no longer proportional to electrical field => there is a miximum velocity vsat
"mobility degradation": less Ids than expected => collision with oxide caused by high vertical Vgs
"channel length modulation": ideally, Isat is no longer dependent on Vds. In reality, Isat increases somewhat as Vds increases => caused by high later Vds, depletion region increase to shorten the channel length
"body effect": threshold increase => caused by rising potentail betwwen source and body
"drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL)": increased Vds reduce Vt
"short channel effect": increased channel lenght increase Vt
"subtreshold conduction": when Vgs < Vt, Ids not totally 0
"gate leakage": caused by tunnel effect when gate oxide is too thin
"junction leakage": reverse-biased source and drain diffusions
In summary, MOS degrade with termperature => 1) mobility effect in ON transistor => lower Ids at high temperature; 2) threshold effect (body effect, DIBL, short channel effect) in OFF transistor => high leakge at high temperature;
2.4.1
mobility degradation lead to use ueff instead of u => ueff < u => Vgs dependent from equatilon 2.23 
velocity saturation is ueff and E dependent from equation 2.24
a simpler approach is to observe, in velocity saturated transistors, Ids grows linearly rather than quadratically with Vgs when the transistor is strongly ON
2.4.2
note that Ids does not dependent on Vds in saturation ideally
drain-to-body junction is reverse-biased, increase Vds will increase the space charge region so the channel is shorten => shorter channel can have larger Ids (mobility degradation decrease) => As a result, in saturation, Ids increase somehow as Vds increase
2.4.3
Vt increase with Vs and L, decrease with Vb and Vd
2.4.3.1
if Vsb increases, the required charges to invert channel increase => Vt increase => TBD: See Semiconductor Physics section 10.3.5
because the voltage difference between the source and body affects the Vt, the body can be thought of as a second gate that helps determine how the transistor turns on and off
TBD: section 2.5.4 and 5.3.4 describe how a body bias is used
2.4.3.2
DIBL lowers Vt as Vds increase => as a result it has a similar effect as channel length modulation, but has additional effect on leakage => TBD: what exactly DIBL do?
2.4.3.3
in general, L increase, Vt will increase => TBD: there could be a lot of cuase?
the depletion regions between source/drain and body extends to channel (help with inverting channel), therefore if L increase, this help decreases, causing Vt to increase
2.4.4
3 types of leakage: 1) subtreshold conduction between source and drain; 2) gate leakge to body; 3) junction leakage from source/drain to body;
2.4.4.1
week inversion
subthreshold leakage current increase significently with Vds => Vds increase, so Vt decrease due to DIBL => Ids increases
Due to subthreshold leakage, DRAM need periodic refresh
subthreshold leakge is a major problem for low Vt or high temperature => TBD: why high temperature
2.4.4.2
2 types of gate tunneling: 1) FN tunneling; 2) direct tunneling;
FN tunneling at high voltage and moderate oxide is used to program EEPROM memory => TBD: section 12.4
direct tunneling at low voltage and thin oxide is used to calculate leakage component
the oxide thickness is now limited to be at least 10.5 Angstroms => a handful of SiO2
2.4.4.3
heavily doped drains are subject to band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) and gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL)
BTBT happens at reverse-biased junction between source/drain and body when traps shorten the tunnel distance
GIDL become problem when Vgd is negative (Vd > Vg) and larger than VDD and gate partial overlap drain
2.4.5
mobility decreases with temperature => more collision
Vt decreases with temperature
Ion at high Vdd decreases with temperature
subthreshold leakage increases exponentially with temperature
BTBT increases slowly with temperature
gate leakage almost independent of temperature
Figure 2.23 and 2.24 gives a combined effect of temperature => OFF current increases and ON current decreases at high temperature => worst case
exception low VDD (<0.7-1.1V), Isat increase with temeprature => TBD: why
2.4.6
Geometry dependence
2.4.7
pass transistor suffers from threshold drops
low-Vt used for high performance while high-Vt used for low leakage 
due to velocity saturation and mobility degradation, high VDD is of no much meaning, keep it low save power somehow
transistors in series drop part of the voltage across each transistor and thus experience smaller fields and less velocity saturation than single transistors (and also consume more power proportionally of course) => TBD: that's why in chapter 4 the Elmore delay model somehow overestimates the delay
2.5.1
Figure 2.26 gives a summary of DC characteristic
in Table 2.3 note that in C region both pMOS and nMOS are in saturation
to gain a equal betas pMOS must be 2-3 larger wide as nMOS due to the lower hole mobility
Because both mobility and the magnitude of the threshold voltage decrease with temperature for nMOS and pMOS transistors, the input threshold of the gate is only weakly sensitive to temperature
2.5.2
skewed, HI-skewed, LO-skewed
by adjusing the width, threshold cen be moved
2.5.3
NML = VIL - VOL
NMH = VOH - VIH
the input characteristic has less indeterminate region than output (since output is driven by CMOS), so the equation is to keep both value positive showing the difference
in general VIL shall be close to VOL to minimize the indeterminate region => call for high gain
2.5.4
it is not until Vt is closer to 1/3 of VDD, the threshold drop problem become critical => use CMOS to solve this problem => using transmission gates => recal how a transmission gate is built
a transmission gate consists of an nMOS transistor and a pMOS transistor in parallel with gates controlled by complementary signals. When the transmission gate is ON, at least one of the two transistors is ON for any output voltage and hence, the transmission gate passes both 0s and 1s well. The transmission gate is a fundamental and ubiquitous component in MOS logic. It finds use as a multiplexing element, a logic structure, a latch element, and an analog switch. The transmission gate acts as a voltage-controlled switch connecting the input and the output
2.6
assuming a transistor with twice the drawn length has exactly half the current => TBD: recall 2.4.6
to use transmission gates in place of pass transistors => TBD: if pass transistor is not good, where do we need it?
