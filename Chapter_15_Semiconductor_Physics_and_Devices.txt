#Chapter 15: Semiconductor Microwave and Power Devices

Scratch:
15.1
Tunnel Diode, Esaki diode => a pn junction in which both n and p region are degenerately doped => fermi Energy in valance band or conduction band => at 0 K, electrons still in n region conduction band and holes in p region valance band
high doping concentration leads to narrow charge region (50 Armstrong) => why? recall
When forward-bias voltage applied, electrons need less effort to reach p region => part of buit-in barrier is counteracted by forward-bias voltage => less elctrical field is required to balance the rest of buit-in barrier => the space charge region is narrower. So the energy band from P to N bends downwards less.
For V < Vp, tunneling current dominates, for Vp < V < Vv, tunneling current decrease more than diffusion current increase, for Vv < V, diffusion current dominates.
Why tunneling electrons decreases? => as V increases, egnery band bends less, less electrons-holes in oppsite side => the relative position of Fermi Energy in n conduction and p valance is fixed, watch the opposite parts between n conduction under Efermi and p valance over Efermi.
A decrease in current with an increase in voltage means a negative differential resistance between Vp and Vv => Why needed for oscillator?
The small signal input impedance => TBD: need circuit knowledge!
Their is a maximum resistive cutoff frequency fr, a value larger than this results in a loss of negative resistance characteric.
tunneling process is a majority carrier effect => TBD: how to understand and what is its use?
note that tunneling current will increase monotonically and repidly with revers-biased voltage.
15.2
A less curved upper valley over the lower valley => less curved means larger effective mass => TBD: change slow => drift current decreases
Mechanism => TBD: more to learn
15.3
A negative differential resistance is presented by a 180 degress of phase shift of voltage and current, which is differnt from the mechanism in tunneling diode. => TBD: more to learn
15.4.1
vertical bipolar npn transistor, but with collector at the bottom to increase cross section
low doped primary collector region for allow large base-cllector voltage without breakdown
high doped secondary collector region to reduce resistance
large base width to prevent puch-through breakdown
interdigitated structure to prevent emitter current crowding effects
15.4.2
wide base width => smaller current gain beta => TBD: why?
large area device => large junction capacitance => lower cutff frequency
maximum rated collector current Ic,max <= wires capability, enough current gain, maximum power dissipation
maximum rated voltage Vce,sus <= avalanche breakdown
second breakdown <= high voltage AND high curent, positive feedback, results in melting and short circuit
maximum rated power Pt = VceIc
SOA is bounded by Ic,max, Vce,sus, Pt and second breakdown
15.4.3
use darlington pair to increase current gain beta total = beta A + beta B + beta A * beta B => effective
The use of a diode => turn off device faster => TBD: how?

15.5.1
Adavantage of power MOSFET over BJT is input impedance is extremely large => constant current
large width is required for large current, achieved by repetitive pattern of small cells in parallel
moderate doping => breakdown occurs more easily when heavy doping
how to defined channel length and width?
DMOS and VMOS => TBD more to learn
15.5.2 
on resistance Ron = Rs + Rch + Rd => source and drain resistance are not negligble
current increase => power dissipation increase => temperature higher => mobility lower => Rch larger => current limited
Compared to power BJT, faster switching time, no second breakdown, stable gain over temperature range => TBD: why no second breakdown?
stability => negative feedback to limit the current
SOA for power MOSFET is also definedy by 3 factors: Id,max, BVdss, PT = Vds * Id
15.5.3
note that ohmic contact of source also contact the p region so that in steady state voltage between body and source is 0, the parastic BJT is cutoff
snapback breakdown => TBD: refer to 11.4.1
