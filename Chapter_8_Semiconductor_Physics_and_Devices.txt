#Chapter 8: The pn Junction Diode

scratch:

remind the excess minority carrier in chapter 6

8.34 why there is no recombination of minority carriers in the short region

Checkpoint:
	
*	Q:	Describe the mechanism of charge flow across the space charge region of a pn junction when a forward-bias voltage is applied.

	A:	The barrier holded the holes back in p region and electrons back in n region.
		After applying forward-bias voltage, the total potential barrier is lowered.
		The Fermi Energy level in p region is lowered than that in n region. => TBD: how to comprehen this?
		More holes from p region and electrons from n region are ionized and cross through space charge region.
		These charges become the excess minority carrier in the other side and form a diffusion current.
	
*	Q:	State the boundary conditions for the minority carrier concentrations at the edge of the space charge region.
	
	A:	starting from Vbi = Vt * ln (Na * Nd / ni^2).
		Given npo = ni^2 / nn0.
		Assuming nno quasi = Nd.
		minority electrons/holes in p/n region are related to majority electrons/holes in n/p region :  np0 = nn0 * e^ (-Vbi / Vt) in thermal equilibrium.
		Replacing Vbi by (Vbi - Va).
		A function of minority electrons/holes in p/n region on account of the minority electrons/holes in thermal equilibrium and Va.
		np = np0 * exp(Va/Vt) and pn = pn0 * exp(Va/Vt) are the boundary conditions of minority carrier concentration at the edge.
	
*	Q:	Derive the expressions for the steady-state minority carrier concentrations in the pn junction.
	
	A:	Follows the ambipolar transport mentioned in chapter 6.
		electric field is almost zero in n/p bulk.
		generation rate is also zero in bulk.
		steady-state means that delta pn / delta t = 0 and delta np / delta t = 0
		Boundary condition as mentioned above.
		Assuming in end of n/p bulk, delta pn or delta np reduce to 0.
		Then both excess minority carrier concentration decay exponentially with distance away from junction.
	
*	Q:	Derive the ideal current–voltage relationship for a pn junction diode.
		
	A:	Assuming the current is a continuous function, it shall be diffusion hole current at xn + diffusion electron current at -xp
	
*	Q:	Describe the characteristics of a “short” diode.

	A:	A short diode means the boundary condition of delta pn or delta np are not 0 at end of n/p bulk.
		Note the saying in 8.30
		Assuming Wn where the excess carrier concentration reduce to 0.
		The diffusion current is larger and constant since the minority carrier concentration is linear to distance.
		Constant current means no recombination of minority carriers => TBD
	
*	Q:	Describe generation and recombination currents in a pn junction.

	A:	Refer to Chapter 6 for more information
		According to Schokley-Read-Hal recombination theory, 
		when reverse-biased voltage applied, assume no mobile electrons/holes in space charge region.
		Recombination rate R is negative, meaning a generation of electrons-hole pairs in space charge region.
		The generated pairs are swept out of space charge region, forming a reverse-biased current.
		This current is in addition to the ideal reverse-biased saturation current.
		The generation current is function of the depletion width, which in turn is a function of reverse-biased voltage.
		The generation current is the dominant reverse-biased current in a silicon pn junction diode compared to ideal saturation current.
		when forward-bias voltage applied, some mobile electron/holes do exists in space charge region.
		Some Recombination rate reaches the max value at the mettalurgical junction.
		The recombination current is an integral of e*R over the space charge junction width multiplied by a customary factor.
		Due to the recombination, additional holes/electrons are injected from p/n region to compensate the loss, which forms the recombination current.
		Thus the recombination current is in addition to the ideal forward-bias diffusion current.
		In lograithmus expression, ideal diffusion current has a slope of 1 and a value of Js at x=0.
		Recombination current has a slope of 1/2 and a value of JR0 at x=0.
		JR0 is larger than Js.
		The total forward-bias current is the sum of both current.
		For low Va, recombination current is dominant, while for high Va, ideal diffusion current is dominant.
		The V-I relationship is thus has an extra coefficient Is range from 1 to 2.

*	Q:	Define high-level injection and describe its effect on the diode I–V characteristics.

	A:	High-level injection means the excess minority carrier concentration is larger than the majority carrier concentration.
		The current is then porportional to the excess carrier concentration.
		It takes a larger increase in diode voltage to produce a given increase in diode current. => TBD: how
		Combining Recombination effect and High-level injection effect, the V-I relationship shows former at low and latter at high, in the middle shows the ideal characteristic.
	
*	Q:	Describe what is meant by diffusion resistance and diffusion capacitance.

	A:	The reciprocal of dVa/dID at Va = V0 is so-called diffusion resistance.
		The diffusion capacitance is different from junction capacitance in the physical mechanism. => TBD: remind that
		In forward-bias pn junction, diffusion current is larger than junction capacitance.
		Assuming the distribution of minority concentration reaches steady-state much quicker than the change period of voltage.
		The difference between minority carrier concentration at differnt time is charged and discharged over the time, which leads to diffussion capacitance.
	
*	Q:	Describe the turn-off transient response in a pn junction.

	A:	
		The reverse current is -VR / RR (actually shall be (Va-BR) / RR).
		If current smaller than it, a reverse-biased voltage is simultaneously put on the pn junction, which is impossible considering the capacitance.
		If current larger than it, a forward-bias voltage is put on the pn junction, which violate the assumption.
		Therefore the Current is changed to -VR / RR right after switch off and kept for a while.
		This period is so called storage time, during which the execess minoriy carriers are being removed to achieve thermal-equilibrium.
		During the storage time, the voltage and current across the junction are kept unchanged.
		After storage time, the voltage and current start to decrease, leading this period to transition time.
		The total turn-off time is the sum of storage time ts + the transition time t2
