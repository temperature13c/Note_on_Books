#Chapter 1: Electromagnetic theory

Scratch:
1.1
what is electrical size?
cellular frequency reuse
1.2
electrical displacement current => founded by Maaxwell and added in Ampere-Maxwell equation
1.3
loss due to dielectric damping and conductivity loss => indistinguishable => both treated as the tatal effective conductivity
loss tangent = real part / imaginary part
for boundary condition, use divergence equations for normal components and curl equations for tangential components
equation 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 and 1.37 are most general expression for the boundary condition
special cases:
case 1: interface between 2 lossless dielectric materials => charges densities = 0 and surface current density = 0 => why? => TBD
case 2: interface with a perfect conductor (electric wall) => field components inside conductor = 0 => tangential E vanish
case 3: interface with a magnetic wall => tangential H vanish
radiation condition
1.4
wave equation, Helmholtz equation for E and H wiht propogation constant k => w * sqrt (permeability * permittivity) phase constant or wave number
in lossless medium, permeability, permittivity and k are real number
phase velocity, wave length
intrinsic impedance, wave impedance, TEM
plane waves in a general lossy medium => a conductivity exists => cmoplex propagation constant => attenuation constant and phase constant
plane waves in a good conductor => conductive current >> displacement current 
skin depth
1.5
plane wave, RHCP, LHCP
