#Chapter 11: Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor: Additional Concepts

scratch:
How to connect Figure 11.2 to Figure 11.3: Note that the PN junction lower energy band in n region due to the internal electrical field from n region to p region, which means the electrons need to consume energy to get to p region. Another side, the positive VDS and VSB lower the energy band further.
The channel modulation shows that the drain current still keep increasing for a small amount after saturation since the increase of VDS shorten the channel length, which as a result increase further the drain current. Since current is correlated to VDS, the output resistance is not infinite.
The near avalanche and snapback breakdown, why it the source pn junction forward-biased when avalance near drain produce holes which injected into substrate? Require Chapter 12
Figure 11.25 shows the potential difference betwwen source, channel and drain, all are relative
