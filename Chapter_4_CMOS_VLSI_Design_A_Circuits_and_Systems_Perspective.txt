#Chapter 4:  Delay

Scratch:
4.1.1
propagation delay time: max. 50% input to 50% output
contamination delay time: min. 50% input to 50% output
rise time: 20% to 80%
fall time: 80% to 20%
a timing analyzer computes the arrival times of 1) inputs; 2) outputs; 3) internal nodes;
4.1.2
critical path in for levels: 1) microarchitectural; 2) logical: fan-in, fan-out; 3) circuit: transistor size; 4) layout: floorplan;
methods to determine the delay: 1) transient response; 2) RC delay model; 3) logical effort; etc.
4.2
main capacity consists of: 1) gate capacitance of load; 2) diffusion capacitance of the driver;
Figure 4.3 shows 5 sources of output capacitance: x1p & x1n drain to body (diffusion capacitance => driver capacitance), wire (=> load capacitance), x2p & x2n gate to body (gate capacitance => load capacitance);
why others not account => connect to constant VCC or GND
if long-channel model applied, current saturation first, then linear regime => output voltage decreases linearly first, then exponential
bootstrapping => TBD section 4.4.6.6
transient response difference among 1) Shockley long-channel model; 2) SPICE; 3) RC Model;
note that 1) RC model estimate tpd quiet good (close to SPICE), but tf is overestimated; 2) Long-channel underestimate tpd since it does not consider the velocity saturation;
4.3.1
RC model treat a transistor as a switch + a resistor (Effective Resistance = Vds / Ids) => TBD: 4.37 how to determine
an unit nMOS is R (TBD: related to minimum length lambda?), an unit of pMOS is 2R-3R due to lower carrier mobility
if w => kw, then R => R/k
if l => kl, then I => I/k, R => kR
note series transistor run faster then expected due to smaller Vds less velocity-saturated
4.3.2
gate capacitance: 1) if w => kw, then C => C (unchanged); 2) if l => kl, then C => kC;
source/drain capacitance: 1) if w => kw, C => kC; 2) if l => kl, then C => C (unchanged);
4.3.3
lower mobility of holes: 1) k-size nMOS: R/k & kC; 2) k-size pMOS: 2R/k & kC;
resistances in nMOS and pMOS are designed to achiveve equal R in worst case (rising and fall)
4.3.4
scaled resistance R' = Rln2 replaced in RC model => represent Vout = VDD/2
simplify 2nd order to 1st order => t = t1 + t2 = R1*C1 + (R1 + R2)*C2 => note this simplification is good for output but not good enough for intermediate node
4.3.5
Elmore model: 1) source is unique; 2) relative resistance do NOT count R in leaf;
example 4.7 calculates 1) tpdf when lowest nMOS turn on; 2) tpdr when lowest nMOS turn off; 
example 4.8 calculates 1) tcdf when highest nMOS turn on; 2) tcdr when all pMOS turn on;
4.3.6
what is shared contacted, isolated contacted, merged uncontacted diffusion
shared contacted diffusion and merged uncontacted diffusion has small capacitance than normal
folding technique help to reduce the diffusion capacitance
4.4
for normilized delay d = tpd / tao = f + p = g * h + p, g is logical effort (gate complexity, ratio of Cin / Cinv(3RC)), h = m/w is electrical effort (fanout, Cout / Cin), f is effort delay or stage effort, p is parasitic delay (ratio of capacitance between Cdiff / Cgate);
4.4.1
table 4.2 shows the change of logical effort with different input number.
the logical effort of multiplexer composed of tristate is indpendent of input number
4.4.2
though parasitic delay is independent of transistor size, by folding, larger gates tend to have slightly lower parasitic delay
applying Elmore model, the parasitic delay of NAND is quadratically related to input number, indicating the splite of a larger gate into 2
4.4.3
FO4 delay estimation
a ring oscillator can be used to check if a chip is faster or slower than nominally expected
4.4.4
TBD: if define drive to be x = Cin / g, as a number of unit input capacitance, d = g * Cout / Cin + p = Cout / x + p. This formation is more intuitive since x express directly the ratio how it change the output capacitance without considering which type of gate it is (different g).
4.4.5
2 examples of how to find logical effort from data sheet
4.4.6.1
input rise time increase => delay increase
4.4.6.2
multiple serial input => delay longer than expected since both are onyl partially on at first
multiple parallel input => delay shorter than expected since both deliver current
4.4.6.3
observe that N transistors in series are equivalent to 1 transistor with N times the channel length
equation 4.28 gives the ratio of Isat between N transistors in serie and 1 transistor N times long
in estimation transistors are assumed to work in saturation where R is relatively large, so in case that the velocity is less saturated, R becomes smaller then predicted
TBD: recall chapter 2
4.4.6.4
TBD: recall chapter 2
4.4.6.5
TBD: recall section 2.3.2: 
Cgs need to be added when source of a transistor changes value => TBD: case?
4.4.6.6
Cgd bootstraps the Voutput => negliable except for Miller effect => TBD
4.5.1
F = GBH; G = product of gi; H = Cout/Cin; B = product of bi;
D = Df + P; Df = sum of fi; P = sum of pi;
the sum of a set of numbers whose product is constant is minimized by choosing all the numbers to be equal => minimal Df is achieved by set each fi = F^(1/N) so D = N * F^(1/N) + P
equation 4.41 gvies a backward calculation methods
Example 4.13 shows that not only the load the path must drive but also the load the path may present to the former driver.
4.5.2
equation 4.43 explain why best stage effort is about 4 => FO4 is a representive logic gate delay
4.5.3
Example facing chicken-and-egg problem
4.5.4
summary => TBD: for review
4.5.5
limitation of logical effor: 1) no account for interconnect, applicable for high-speed circuits such as adder, multiplier, memories etc where wire delay not dominant; 2) unable to solve speed-fixed contraints; 3) nonuniform branching is hard to calculate; 4) input slope is not considered;
4.5.6
TBD
4.6
models in timing analyzer: 1) slope-based linear model: calculate input slope proportional to previous stage delay; 2) nonlinear delay model: lookup table and interpolation; 3) current source model;
4.7
increasing the size not only decreases its resistance and thus makes it faster at driving a constant load, but also increases input capacitance and makes the previous stage slower
