#Chapter 13: The Junction Field-Effect Transistor

scratch:
2 types of JFET: pn JFET (pn junction) and MESFET (Schottky barrier rectifying junction)
what is an unipolar transistor? Only one type of carrier, the majority carrier, in involved in the operation.
13.3.1
a depletion mode device means a voltage must be applied to the gate terminal to turn the device off
a enhancement mode device means a voltage must be applied to the gate terminal to turn the device on
note that space charge region has nearly no carriers
in case of constant vDS, vGS increases, the space charge region are widened, resistance become larger until pinch off when resistance is infinite => no current pass through channel. vDS and iDS are always linear related.
in case of constant vGS = 0, vDS incresase, the space charge region near drain is widened, reistance become larger until pinch off when resistance is infinite => constant current pass through channel. vDS and iDS are not linear related. Note that in this pinchoff, the width of space charge region is relatively short, which allows the carriers injected from source are swept to drain by the internal electrical field.
13.1.2
pinoff, threshold
recall Shotkky barrier and ohmic contact => TBD
13.2.1
internal pinchoff voltage Vp0, pinchoff voltage Vp, built in voltage Vbi
for n-channel pn JFET => Vp = Vbi - Vp0 => pinchoff voltage is negative
for p-channel pn JFET => Vp = Vp0 - Vbi => pinch off voltage is positive
considering VGS
for n-channel pn JFET => VDS(sat) = Vp0 - (Vbi - VGS) => D to S positive
for p-channel pn JFET => VSD(sat) = Vp0 - (Vbi + VGS) => S to D positive
note that as |VGS| increase, Vsat decrease => larger VGS reverse biased extends the space charge region more, so saturation is more easy to achieve
13.2.2
skip the deduction and use the equation 13.14, As |VGS| increase, saturation current decrease
13.2.3
The definition of transconductance => also used in MOS, describes how much the change of control voltage affect the change of output current
13.2.4
TBD
