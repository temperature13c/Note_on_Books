#Chapter 5: Power

Scratch:
5.1.2
When an inverter input switches from 1 to 0, VDD charge half energy to the output capacitance, and half dissipates in pMOS; when it switches from 0 to 1, no energy is drawn from VDD, the hald energy in output capacitance is dissipated in nMOS
Definition of dynamic power Pswiching = alpha * C * VDD^2 * f. Note that the activity factor is the probability that output change from 0 to 1 since only it consumes power. E.g. alpha of clock = 1, alpha of register = 0.5
5.1.3
Power dissipation has 2 parts: dynamic dissipation and static dissipation.
dynamic dissipation has 2 parts: charging and discharging of load capacitances as gate switches; short-circuits current when pMOS and nMOS are partial ON
static dissipation has 4 parts: subtrheshold leakage through OFF transistors (Note there is also leakage when transistors switches); gate leakage; junction leakage s/d; contention current => TBD: section 9.2.2
3 modes: active, standby and sleep
leakage become a larger main factor in non-meter tech, so does High-speed I/O
5.2.1
clock gating (stop the clock) can save the power. => TBD: section 10.3.5 discusses enable register design
why clock gating signals are some of the most critical paths for the design => TBD
Use latch to prevent enable change before clock falls => Figure 5.7: enable is latched at falling edge, then AND enable and clock produce a clock which is stablized about half cycle before the clock rising edge (used for targeted blocks)
Why swithing probability of uncorrelated data is 0.25 => P * not P = 0.5 * 0.5
Glitches consummes more power (active factor > 1), often happen at ripple carry adder and array multiplier => TBD: chapter 11
5.2.2
switch capacitance has 2 parts: wire and transistors
high data exchange design shall be put close to reduce wire capacitance
trade-off between small stage effort and power consumption => increase stage effort to reduce gate size (saving power) => such as IO with a stage effort of 8-12 => register has smaller gate size since it has higher active factor than combinational logic normally => since it triggered by clock?
in general, large energy savings can be made by relaxing a circuit a small amount from the minimum delay point
if wire is long, use inverter or buffer to drive is energy-efficient => TBD: Chapter 6
5.2.2.1 => Skip
5.2.3
as many transistors are operating in a velocity-saturated regime, the lower power supply may not reduce performance as much as long-channel models predict => TBD: review chapter 2
high voltage domain for cell stability (memory); middle for processor; low for IO at lower speeds
High voltage domain to Low voltage domain can be directly bridged but note a case if the bridged low voltage register runs faster than other nominal low voltage regsiter (TBD: why? => reach threshold faster), so the contamination delay must calculate this effect.
however low voltage domain can NOT bridged to high low voltage domain directly => causing nMOS and pMOS on at the same time => use level converter at Figure 5.15
level converter => consider use pMOS in high voltage domain and nMOS in low voltage domain => disadvantage: delay and power => alleviated by register (providing no level converter is required in combinational logic)
use voltage domains either 1) associate each domain wiht a area of the floorplan (then level converter should be placed at the boundary) 2) use CVS to mix 2 domains in the block
DVFS either use 1) lookup table to find relation between frequency and voltage or 2) ring oscillator to tracks the performance and then feedback => TBD: 7.5.3.4
DVS is also effective at reducing leakage during periods of low activity since subthreshold and gate leakage are strongly sensitive to the supply voltage => TBD: chapter 2
5.2.4
performance can be recouped through parallelism => TBD: 5.5.2
5.2.5
short-circuit current has more power dissipation when input edge rate slower and less power dissipation when load capacitance increases => large capacitance cause less output swing
ratio v = Vt / VDD => if larger than 0.5, no short-circuit current => in nanometer process, Vt scarcely fall below 0.3 V without excessive leakage => short-circuit current is negligible => TBD: why not below 0.3 V
5.2.6
resonant circuit => store energy for clock
5.3
CMOS replace nMOS => the contention current of nMOS limits the number of transistors in chip
static power contains 1) subtrheshold leakage 2) gate leakage 3) junction leakage 4) contention current
5.3.1
5.3.1.1
subthreshold leakage equation (5.19) coefficients 1) Ioff => high when low-Vt and low when high-Vt: defining OFF transistor current; 2) DIBL-effect with (Vds -VDD) (TBD: Drain-induced barrier lowering is a short-channel effect: drain close to gate so that transistor is turned on prematurely), effectiver when geometry shrinks; 3) Body effect (TBD: also turn on channel prematurely)
Ioff => higher temperature lowers Vt, and increase Ioff 4) Vgs
stack effect => series transistors leak less. See Figure 5.20 and its explaination => a feedback system
SOI circuits are attractive for low-leakage design => TBD: chapter 9.5
5.3.1.2
gate leakage is a strong function of dielectric thickness
pMOS leakage is 1 order smaller than nMOS in SiO2 dielectric
gate leakage also depends on voltage acrosss the gate => stack effect can alleviate the leakage by putting the OFF transistor closer to the rail (TBD: OFF transistor has no leakage, the point is to let ON transistor has smaller Vgs)
table 5.2 shows a typical NAND3 leakage summary => TBD: need chapter 2
5.3.1.3
junction leakage caused by source/drain diffusion region with a differnt potintial from the substrate
BTBT and GIDL can result in leakage current => TBD: what is BTBT and GIDL
5.3.1.4
static CMOS circuits have no contention current except special case => TBD: chapter 9.2.2
5.3.1.5
Example 5.4 shows an estimation way => required input: transistor size, number, leakage per size
5.3.2
power gating consists of 1) header transistor 2) power gated block 3) output isolation
state retention registers using 2nd power supply (TBD: 10.4.3) or alternatively store important registers to memory
in case that saving or lossing states cost too much, turn off the power supply to a minimal level using DVS => what is this?
5.3.2.1
power gating can be designed with 1) external disable input to a voltage regulator 2) internal high-Vt header or footer switches
power switch has a neffective resistance so it cause voltage drop on VDDv and increase the delay of the block
the power switch is generally made of many transistors in parallel => to avoid IR and L di/dt drop noise (TBD: 13.3) and electromigration of the power bus (TBD: 7.3.3.1), turn on transistors gradually
5.3.3
Good design practice starts with high-Vt devices everywhere and selectively introduces low-Vt devices where necessary
multiple thresholds requires additonal implant masks (so cost increase) => there is a trade off
Alternative change channel length can also vary the threshold without addition implantation => but the physical size varies
5.3.4
variable threshold CMOS => using body bias to dynamically adjust the threshold voltage
low-Vt devices can be used and a reverse body bias (RBB) can be applied during sleep mode to reduce leakage [Kuroda96]. Alternatively, higher-Vt devices can be used, and then a forward body bias (FBB) can be applied during active mode to increase performance
Body bias can be applied to the power gating transistors to turn them off more effectively during sleep
too much reverse body bias leads to junction leakage through BTBT (TBD: what is this), and too much forward body bias leads to current from body to source. So under 90 nm body bias gain no more benefits
5.3.5
input vector control => specified input vector to minimize the block in sleep => refer to table 5.2
5.4 => TBD: need chapter 2
The minimum energy point typically consumes an order of magnitude less energy than the conventional operating point, but runs at least three orders of magnitude more slowly
thermodynamic minimum of energy per elementary act of information was kT ln2 => TBD: Informationstheory
note that there is a trade off between power and delay
5.5
power rather than number of transistors now limits the chip performance => multicore processors therefore is widely used
5.5.1
memor have a much lower power density than logic due to their low activity factor and regularity
heterogeneous architector take advantage in power consumption than general purpose processor when facing special cases
5.5.2
saving power by parallelism & pipelining
N parallel reduce frequency to 1/N => power reduce by N^2, area multiplied by N
N pipeline reduce logic but add mroe registers
when leakage is important, pipeline is prefered
5.5.3
a trade off between power saving and wake-up time => TBD: section 13.2.5 
5.7
CMOS replace nMOS at mid 1980s due to the increasing power dissipation => nMOS use depletion load nMOS pull ups as resistive loads => gate with output 0 dissipate contention power Figure 5.32
in 1990s Vcc is scaled down from 5V => threshold voltage decrease => subthreshold leakage become an issue. Thinner gate dialectirc lead to gate leakage caused by the quantum mechanical effect
Clock gating is firstly introduced to save power
Voltage domain is then introduced to save power: 1st stage to seperate core and I/O; 2nd stage to seperate memory from core logic => memory use higher voltage for reliability
Body bias and cluster voltage scaling is not widely used
the last measure is to use CMOS instead of nMOS
