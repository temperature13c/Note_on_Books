Scratch:
Chapter 1: introduction
set, ordered sets, upper bound, least upper bound(supremum), greaest lower bound(infimum)
field => a set with 2 operations addition and multiplication, ordered field
existence theorem => there exists an ordered field R which has the least-upper-bound property, R contains Q as a subfield
archimedean property
Q is dense in R => between any 2 real numbers there is a rational one
extended real number system introduce 2 symbols: +inf and -inf => for every x in R, -inf < x < +inf => +inf is an uppoer bound => every non-empty subset has a least upper bound
extended real number system can not form a field

Chapter 2: basic topology
a mapping of A into B => more specific: a mapping of A onto B
domain, value and range of f
image, inverse image
one-to-one mapping => 1-1 corresondence => A and B have the same cardinal number => A and B equivalent A~B
definition of finite, infinite, countable, uncountable, at most countable => example
Note A is infinite if A isequivalant to one of its proper subsets => see 2.5 example
sequence => function f defined on the set J of all positive integers => terms of sequence need not be distinct
Theorem 2.8: every infinite subset of a countable set A is countable => how to understand
union of the sets, the intersection of the sets
not all infinite sets are countable such as the set of all real numbers is uncountable or set of all sequences whose elements are 0 and 1
