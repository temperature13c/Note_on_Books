#Chapter 1: Foundations
------------------------------------------
We get currents by placing voltages acrossing things => voltage is the cause?
resistor are used to convert a voltage to a current, and vice versa => how to understand?
one mark of a good circuit design is insensitivity of the finished circuit to precise values of the components
a battery is a real-life approximation to a voltage source
circuit loading => cause reduction of the open-circuits voltage
Zener diode used in reverse bias, creating a constant voltage with currents between zener breakdown and avalance breakdown => this means usually a resistor shall be added to keep the currents in this range otherwise it works not properly or break down
1.2.6
Figure 1.17 shows that low-voltage zener diode behaves worse than high-voltage zener diode => low-voltage zener diode can be replaced by 2-terminal reference => see 9.10
1.3.2
peak-to-peak amplitude (pp amplitude)
root-mean-square (rms amplitude)
1.4.2 D
THe CMOS buffer provides a low source resistance to prevent input loading by the RC
by adding a series resistor before the capacitor, the max. current is limited without largely change the time constant providing the resistor in parallel with the capacitor is relatively large
1.4.3
unintentional capacitive coupling => form a differentiator
1.4.5
dielectric abosorption => TBD
1.5.1
ideal synchronous buck converter has no energy waste
synchronous buck converter <=> synchronous boost converter
1.5.2
magnetizing inductance <=> leakage inductance
1.6
linear <=> non linear
passive <=> active
1.6.1
diode don't have resistance and don't follow Thevenin equivalent => important
1.6.2
half-wave rectifier <=> full-wave bridge rectifier
1.6.3
center tapped full wave rectifier cause 2 times more heating
1.6.4 rectifier
cockcroft walton generator
1.6.5 regulator
to flatten the ripple, large capacitor is used, which has 3 disadvantage: expensive, heating, ripple still there
therefore in addition to the use of large capacitor, feedback circuit is used => regulator
1.6.6
schottky diode has 0.25V forward drop, lower than 0.6V
many applications: 1.rectify signal; 2.OR gate to pass higher of 2 voltage; 3.clamp range of signal => note that what happens if voltage divider has a small resistance => alternative use op-amp or transistor or use bypass capacitor for time-varying signals => produce small ohms divider resistance; 4. Limiter => use as input protection for a high gain amplifer; 5. nonlinear elements such as log converter;
1.6.7
a RC snubber for suppressing inductive kick in ac => usually used in equipments that run from the ac powerline since power transformer is inductive
bidirectional zener-like voltage-clamping element => TBD
1.6.8
resonant charging is lossless compared with the 50% efficiency of resistive charging
1.7
the output of a linear circuit, driven with a sinewave at some frequency f, is itself a sinewave at the smae frequency with changed amplitude and phase
impedance = resistance + reactacne => generalized resistance => inductor and capacitor are resistive (90 phase difference), resistor are resistive
1.7.1
input impedance <=> output impedance
worst case => maximal output impedance & minimal input impedance
the worst case impedance is just R => why?
1.7.3
a circuit containing only capacitor and inductor always has a purely imaginary impedance, meaning that the voltage and current are 90 degress out of phase => purely reactive
1.7.5
Kirchoff's law in complex form
1.7.6
average power in complex form VI* or V*I
power factor = power / |V||I| = the cosin of the phase angle between voltage and current => 0 = purely reactive, 1 = purely resistive
1.7.9
the worst-case source impedance and load impedance is R in RC filter (lowpass or highpass) => How to understand
Kramers-Kronig relation
1.7.13
note for cascade => make each stage to have much higher impedance then the preceding one => or use active filter
1.7.14
resonant frequency => impedance goes to infinity
parallel LC resonant circuit => tuned circuit => select a particular frequency => quality factor Q = f / width of -3 dB
serie LC resonant circuit => trap a particular frequency
TBD: how is Q calculated

1.9 & 1.10 are introductions to be skipped




#Chapter 2: Bipolar Transistors
------------------------------------------

2.1
BJTs excel in accuracy and low noise, whereas FETs excel in low power, high impedance, and high-current switching
