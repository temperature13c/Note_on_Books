#Chapter 1:  Introduction

Scratch:
MOSFET - where is metal, oxide, semiconductor? What is the character of each? What Field effect, differs from Bipolar?
Forward biased, reverse biased?
N-type, P-type, depends on channel
What is well? Why need well?
nMOS: body to GND, gate high is on, gate low is off
pMOS: body to VDD, gate low is on, gate high is off
The structure of  NAND gate: any of pull-down network is off, ouput is tied to high
General logic of CMOS have pull-up & pull-down network: NAND and NOT
What is High Z and X (unwanted) in CMOS? both network off, both network on
Compound Gate: DeMorgan's law => AOI22 => conduction complements
What is signal strengh: current drive ability: why is nMOS perfect in driving 0, but imperfect (degraded) in driving 1
What is Pass Transistors?
What is Transmission Gates? 
what is the inverting a consequence of static CMOS? requirement of strong stregh in driving both high and low => fully restored, run correctly independently of the physical size of transisitors
What leads CMOS to low enegry dissapation?
What is Tristates? Differ from Transmission Gates? Transmission Gate is built with 2 transisitors and nonrestoring, Tristates is built wiht 4 transistors and restoring
nonrestoring means not using VDD or GND to restore the ouput, therefore noise can be passed from input to output
What is Multiplexer? 2 ways to get restoring multiplexer
Why and how use multiplexer to replace tristates? Contention problem
How is a Latch built from 1 2-MUX and 2 inverters
How is a FF built from 2 latches (one plus one minus sensitive)
Why applying 2 nonoverlapping phases solve the hold time problem?
